    "This assignment is due on Canvas by **MIDNIGHT on Monday, February 8**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",

    "- Any relevant data sets should be available on Canvas. To make life easier on the graders if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.  Here is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.  I also recommend the [wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) for LaTex.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do **Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All** as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- 95 points of this assignment are in problems.  The remaining 5 are for neatness, style, and overall exposition of both code and text.\n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",

    "The sinking of the RMS Titanic was a terrible tragedy that saw the loss of many lives. Even within this tragedy, thanks to the combinations of the records of the White Star Line and the thorough nature of follow-up research after the accident we have some records that can help us try to piece together the course of events on board the ship. Many of the historians and other researchers who have investigated this event have speculated as to what exactly happened.\n",

Be sure to use the `titanic_data.csv` data set, *not* the `clean_titanic_data` file or `dirty_titanic_data` file from the in-class notebook exercises."

However, women were also much more likely to survive than men -- which suggests some evidence of male chivalry (making sure that the women got off the boat first). In regards to age, young adults were more likely to survive, while adults in their 30s were more likely to not survive -- illustrating some evidence of age bias towards the younger population of passengers. Therefore, based on the data, it seems like there was some combination of all three of these characteristics."

Additionally, regardless of month, it seems as though the medians as well as the quartiles hardly change. In regards to favoring one group over the other, since both groupings have similar data, there shouldn't be many reasons to prefer one over the other. However, the second grouping does overlap months with the first, so one may choose the first grouping for less variance.   "
